Hi everyone – my name is Nick Brown and I’m a Director of Product Management at VitalSource. You may not have heard of us, but we’re the world’s largest digital textbook provider – last year we served up 2 billion textbook pages to millions of students around the globe, and we’re really proud of that.

At VitalSource, we’re also big believers in open standards, the open web platform and moving beyond PDF-based digital textbooks that are really no better than print under glass. I’m here to talk to you today about what we think that path forward looks like - what we see coming next for digital learning content.

One of my favorite thinkers about digital learning is Seymour Papert - the inventor of the Logo programming environment which you may be familiar with. Here I've got a quote from his fantastic book Mindstorms - and I think he hits the nail on the head. When it comes to educational technology and perhaps reading content in particular we're very much applying new technology like cloud-based delivery to old instructional tools, like the 1000 page pre-packaged print textbook. The sad thing is - Papert wrote this quote in 1980, and in many ways it's still accurate.

So how do we change that? One common theme we see arising from all over the education space is that books are bursting out of their bindings - there are lots of interesting ideas for delivering mind-sized chunks of interactive content to students in the right context at just the right time. We also see new capabilities landing in the open web platform every day – from new browser APIs that can power interesting new learning modalities, to broader support for rich media, to a growing number of student-centric tools and services available for integration. It’s time to recalibrate our mental image of a digital book, and think outside textbook.

What I have to show today is a suite of demos and experiments focused on two categories of exploration. On the one hand, I've got a number of examples of content that I've put together to try to stretch the limits of a book - exploiting the capabilities of modern browsers and a networked learning environment. On the other hand, we’ve worked hard to make our reading technology modular and interchangeable, to let partners take that great next generation content and make it plug and play into a wide variety of environments, use cases and business models. By tapping into both sides of that equation we can not only create a richer texture of ways to deliver engaging content, but we can deliver those powerful ideas in new and compelling ways.

Let’s begin with the student perspective. How can we deliver an interconnected, interactive, engaging learning experience for students in and around their textbook content?

I studied music in college, and let me tell you, reading a music textbook without being able to hear the music can be an incredibly frustrating experience.

So we can begin there – it’s trivial today to include an audio file in an EPUB 3 book or website, like I've included here. Now as I read the score for one of my favorite pieces, Mendelssohn’s Hebrides Overture, I can listen along.

We can also use Javascript to embed a PDF of the score (within an EPUB 3), and turn the pages of the score in sync with the music, helping me better understand the texture of the piece and follow along with a complex score.

Of course, while audio is an option, video is as well. Let’s take a look at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music Orchestra playing this same piece.

Now you'll notice we made life easy on the student by syncing the position of the score and the audio track across all of those 3 modalities. These are the kinds of subtleties that go beyond simply tossing a link to a Youtube video into your book.

We can even make the listening experience interactive. Here we have a simple exercise that allows you to tap on the screen at the tempo that you’d like your “orchestra” to play.

As a tap with slower beats you'll hear the overture slow down…or I can speed up…to conduct my orchestra. Really fun way to explore the piece.

And, we can even go a step further. Today, most modern mobile browsers like mobile safari and Chrome expose device motion APIs to the page, allowing you to detect positional and acclerometer data. Using that data, I can even physically conduct the orchestra with my iPhone as the baton! Take a look at this, I think it’s really cool.

Again, I can slow down...or speed up my orchestra and really feel the piece in an almost tactile way. Now that's a lot of fun - I wish I’d had this when I was studying music!

Or course playing back music that you’re studying is just one way in which thinking outside the traditional textbook might help you study music. Let’s jump a few chapters forward and study a key concept - timbre.

Timbre can perhaps best be described as the color of sound – it’s what makes a flute playing a B flat sound different from a trumpet playing the same note. But it can be a difficult concept to understand and develop an intuition for. The capabilities of the Web Audio API and some dynamic visualizations built in the browser, as we see in this chapter, can help.

At the core of the concept of timbre is variations in the sound wave associated with any musical note you hear, and the way in which that sound wave is composited by many different pitches, known as harmonics. Here, we use the web’s ability to analyze a sound in real time to do two things – graph the sound wave itself as it's playing, and graph a frequency analysis of that sound in real time. Let's take a look.

Here's the simplest sound wave there is - a single sine curve for a single pitch. You can see a spike for the frequency of the wave, and above it the wave itself.

On the other hand, look at the same visualizations for a trumpet - you can see many spikes for each of the harmonic frequencies, and a very complex waveform. Let's play that one more time - see the large number of harmonics?

Look at how a flute playing that same note differs. Notice the different placement and smaller number of harmonic spikes? That's what makes a flute a flute!

Using this kind of analysis we can visually see the difference between a trumpet and a flute and better understand why timbre has the impact it does on sound.

15 years ago this kind of computation would be so complex as to require a beefy computer and sophisticated software – today Chrome makes it available in the browser trivially to any website or book.

We can even, again, make this interactive, and explore the possibility space of timbre by mixing and matching our own levels of harmonics – here’s what it sounds like if I try to make it sound like a flute by matching the harmonics we saw earlier.

Really fun to explore.

But again, it’s not just about playback and clicking around, we have new and interesting input capabilities as well. What about the timbre of my voice singing the same note? Let’s take a look:

Interesting differences, huh? As I vary the vowel sound and tone of my voice, from round to scratchy to soft to nasal, the harmonics shifted around just like the instruments we visualized.

Finally, this isn’t just rich media, and it isn’t just leveraging new and compelling input tools like device motion and live audio capture, but we’re also working with networked media. This means we can collaborate and learn together.

For example, let’s look at a famous piece of music by Terry Riley called “In C”. “In C” is an experimental piece of music that lists out 53 musical phrases and says to the participants – “play these as many times as you want, and move onto the next phrase any time you want”. Every performance of “In C” is unique, and the only way to truly understand music like this is to play it with other people – listening to a single recording won’t cut it. So what if I could play it with my classmates, in real time, over the internet? Let’s try out it.

Here we have an interactive version of “In C”, where we can start a performance and play solo...

Or, we can add some robots to play along with us...

Or, we can join our friends in a live performance! If you'd like to join too, you can visit the URL I have up here and enter the name for the group - I'll join "books!". Please mute!

As you can see and hear, a few people have already started. We can join in whenever we want – and advance through the piece with our classmates.

How fun was that? Even if this kind of music isn’t your cup of tea you can see it’s a really fun way to learn about it. These kinds of live, real-time collaborative learning experiences with your peers, outside of the classroom, can be a really powerful way to learn that is only possible in this kind of interactive, networked environment.

So, now, let's flip the script. One we've got these kinds of powerful mind-sized chunks of content, how can we get the most mileage out of them? Clearly these aren't as simple to produce as exporting your standard printer PDF and posting it on the web - what can we do to get more return on the investment required to build really high quality digital experiences?

At VitalSource, our answer to that question is a technology we call LearnKit. LearnKit is a set of APIs and SDKs that allows partners - be they publishers, institutions, edtech startups, whoever - to quickly and easily create new learning experiences wrapped around any content delivered in our platform.

What does that mean to you? That means that you can create a next-generation EPUB 3 once, get it into our system and use the content in that book in any number of ways, without rebuilding all of the complex backend architecture that you need to be a best-in-class learning platform. No need to build a content licensing model, note and highlight cross-device syncing, enterprise-level content DRM, a real-time analytics pipeline - instead, you get to focus on the user experience. Let's take a quick tour through a few examples.

The first example is actually...this presentation! Each of the screens I've been showing so far are part of an EPUB 3 book, which is ingested into our platform and licensed to me. I used the LearnKit Javascript API to render out those EPUB 3 chapters right into the flow of an HTML presentation. If I had logged into this presentation as a different user without the right provisioning I wouldn't have seen those slides.

To contrast that, we can look at this same snippet of content within Bookshelf, our etextbook platform.

Here you can see the same chapter on within the Bookshelf UI and UX. In this flavor of LearnKit you can search the content, create notes and highlights, navigate around the entire book and more. It's a fully-featured ereader. Everything that you see here can be built using the same LearnKit tools I used to build this presentation. We've been building on top of LearnKit for over a year now - every page viewed in the last year, all 2 billion of them, were viewed using LearnKit.

Let's take a quick look under the hood. I've labeled a few key areas of Bookshelf with the function that you'd call to pull back a certain chunk of content or user data. Retrieve the table of contents, get the user's highlights, render page 5 - these are the kinds of tools LearnKit exposes to the browser. Of course, you can use these to build something that looks completely different from Bookshelf.

For example, here is a kid-friendly reader built using LearnKit that looks completely different and tackles a completely new vertical market. We built this in a partnership with Scholastic, and while you can see it uses those same functions, as I have them labeled here, and under the hood 95% of the platform is the same, the reading experience is much more appropriate for Scholastic's grade school audience.

And you don't need to build an entire ereader. We're currently working with multiple  partners who want to display just a small chunk of content in another context. Think of an adaptive courseware platform, that allows the learner to get a question right or wrong and right there within that context see the appropriate chunk of content to set them back on the right track.

The key here is to get the student the right content or interactive exercise - not to build a lot of bells and whistles and features around the content, or overwhelm them with an entire thousand page textbook.

That kind of simple content snippet experience is really easy to build with LearnKit. You can see in this example that we can set the start and stop page, and tweak it, and just the perfect chunk of content will render out. Build the content once - it may be just a portion of text, it may be our interactive collaborative "In C" music player, or anything in between - and reuse that chunk of content as often as you need in any context.

One last example shows how this kind of content reuse isn't important just for students. This is a tool that we call Bookshelf GPS, built in partnership with a company called Cerego.

Bookshelf GPS enables instructors to add a rich engagement layer on top of an existing textbook, building a bank of concepts and ideas they want their students to learn. How do they author that structured bank of knowledge? Using LearnKit!

Here you can see side by side, the source material in the textbook, and Cerego's authoring tools. An instructor can copy material from the text, drag and drop over their highlighted passages or even pull from a list of the key figures and diagrams in the book, all extracted using simple LearnKit calls, to make their activity creation even faster.

Then on the student side of things, as they're studying those learning items that have been assigned to them, if there's one they don't know, they can quickly bounce back and forth into the source text, and back to the question answering tool, again with that content embedded using LearnKit.

Add it all up and this is the kind of flexibility afforded to us by the digital medium we're working in - we can support reusing simple content chunks, building complex learning applications, rolling all kinds of flavors of ereaders, embedding page viewers, creating interactive authoring environments, and more, all wrapped around the same source content.

And that content can be far removed from a flat print textbook - we can use audio and video and visual media, we can leverage new input and interaction modalities, and build integrated collaborative experiences, baked right into our books files using EPUB 3. We can be far removed from simply applying our technology to old instructional methods.

This is what will enable us to break out from a world of paper under glass textbooks. It's such an exciting time to be building for education using this technology, and I can't wait to see what we can cook up together to deliver powerful ideas to students.

Thanks.
