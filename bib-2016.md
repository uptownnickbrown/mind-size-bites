Think outside the textbook – powerful ideas in mind-size bites

Hi everyone – my name is Nick Brown and I’m a Director of Product Management at VitalSource. You may not have heard of us, but we’re the world’s largest digital textbook provider – last year we served up 2 billion textbook pages to millions of students around the globe, and we’re really proud of that.

We’re also big believers in open standards, the open web platform and moving beyond PDF-based textbooks that are really no better than print under glass. I’m here to talk to you today about what we see coming next for digital textbooks and learning content. We see books busting out of their bindings, and a need to support granular, mind-sized chunks of interactive content delivered through a panoply of new user experiences.

We also see new capabilities landing in the open web platform every day – from new browser APIs that can power interesting new learning modalities, to broader support for rich media, to a growing number of student-centric tools and APIs available for integration. It’s time to recalibrate your mental image of a digital book, and think outside textbook.

What I have to show today is a suite of demos and experiments focused on two categories of exploration. On the one hand, modern browsers and a broad spectrum of resources available over the web have opened up new input modalities and interesting interactive possibilities for students. I'll show you a few examples of that. On the other hand, we’ve worked hard to make our technology modular and interchangeable, to take that great next generation content and make it plug and play into a wide variety of environments, use cases and business models. By tapping into both sides of that equation we can not only create a richer texture of ways for students to learn digitally, but we can deliver those powerful ideas in new and compelling ways.

Let’s begin with the student perspective. How can we deliver an interconnected, interactive, engaging learning experience for students in and around their textbook content? Lots of ways.

For example, I studied music in college, and let me tell you, reading a music textbook without being able to hear the music can be an incredibly frustrating experience.

So let’s start there – it’s trivial today to include an audio file in an EPUB 3 book or website, like I have here. Now as I read the score for one of my favorite pieces, Mendelssohn’s Hebrides Overture, I can listen along.

(play 15 secs of the overture)

We can also use Javascript to highlight the score as the audio plays, helping me better understand the texture of the piece and follow along with a complex score.

(15 secs with follow-along)

Of course, if audio is an option, video is as well. Let’s take a look at the San Francisco symphony orchestra playing the same piece.

(15 secs of an orchestra playing the overture)

Now you'll notice we made life easy on the student by syncing the position of the score across those 3 modalities.

We can even make the listening experience interactive. Here we have a simple exercise that allows you to tap on the screen at the speed that you’d like your “orchestra” to play.

(start audio)

I can slow down…or speed up…to conduct my orchestra. Really fun way to explore the piece.

(stop audio, take out phone baton)

And, we can even go a step further. Using device motion APIs available in modern mobile browsers, I can even conduct the orchestra with my iPhone as the baton! Take a look at this, I think it’s really cool.

(conduct orchestra - slow down, speed back up, stop)

Now that's a lot of fun - I wish I’d had this when I was studying music.

“timbre chapter”

Or course playing back music that you’re studying is just one way in which thinking outside the traditional textbook might help you study music. Let’s jump a few chapters forward and study a key concept - timbre.

(open up the timbre chapter)

Timbre can perhaps best be described as the color of sound – it’s what makes a flute playing a B flat sound different from a trumpet playing the same note. But it can be a difficult concept to understand and develop an intuition for. The emerging Web Audio API and some dynamic visualizations in the browser, as used within this book, can help.

At the core of the concept of timbre is the sound wave for any given note you hear, as composited by many different component sound waves, known as harmonics. Here we use the web’s ability to analyze a sound in real time to do two things – graph the sound wave itself as it's playing, and graph a frequency analysis of that sound in real time. Let's take a look.

Here's the simplest sound wave there is - a single sine curve for a single pitch. You can see a spike for the frequency of the wave, and here's the wave itself.

(play a simple waveform)

On the other hand here is a trumpet - you can see many spikes for each of the harmonic frequencies, and a very complex waveform.

(play the trumpet sound)

And here is a flute. Notice the different placement of the harmonic spikes? That's what makes a flute a flute!

(play the flute sound)

15 years ago this kind of computation would be so complex as to require a beefy computer and sophisticated software – today Chrome makes it available in the browser trivially to any website or book.

Using this kind of analysis we can visually see the difference between a trumpet and a flute and better understand why timbre has the impact it does.

We can even, again, make this interactive, and explore the possibility space of timbre by mixing and matching our own levels of harmonics – here’s what it sounds like if I try to make it sound like a trumpet.

(click around in teropa's timbre widget)

Really fun to explore.

But again it’s not just about playback and clicking around, we have new and interesting input capabilities as well. What about the timbre of my voice singing the same note? Let’s take a look:

(sing the same note into the mic, analyze the timbre).

Interesting differences, huh? You can think of lots of great use cases for capturing live audio, not just in music but in a variety of courses.

“In C”

Finally, this isn’t just rich media, and it isn’t just leveraging new and compelling input tools like device motion and live audio capture, but we’re also working with networked media. This means we can collaborate and learn together.

For example, let’s look at a famous piece of music by Terry Riley called “In C”. “In C” is an experimental piece of music that lists out 53 short phrases and says to the participants – “play these as many times as you want, and move onto the next phrase any time you want”. Every performance of “In C” is unique, and the only way to truly understand music like this is to play it with other people – listening to a single recording won’t cut it. So what if I could play it with my classmates, in real time, over the internet? Let’s try out it.

Here we have an interactive version of “In C” – as you can see and hear, a few people have already started. We can pick our instrument and join in whenever we want – if you’re in the audience, visit this URL now to jump in (and please mute!).

(30 seconds of In C).

How fun was that? Even if that kind of music isn’t your cup of tea you can see it’s a really fun way to learn about it. These kinds of live, real-time collaborative learning experiences with your peers , outside of the classroom, can be a really powerful way to learn that is only possible in this kind of integrated, networked environment.
