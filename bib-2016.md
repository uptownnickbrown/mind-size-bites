Think outside the textbook – powerful ideas in mind-size bitesTextbooks are busting out of their bindings, with personalized learning objects, interactive assessments, granular chunks of content, and orchestration of multiple media sources all co-existing in the modern digital “course”. Driving the future vision of these new learning modalities are web services enabling the simple assembly of new user interfaces, and rapid experimentation with learning process and tools. VitalSource will demonstrate their latest experiments around helping institutions, publishers, and learners tap into this fast, flexible and interconnected learning environment.Hi everyone – my name is Nick Brown and I’m a Director of Product Management at VitalSource. You may not have heard of us, but we’re the world’ largest digital textbook provider – last year we served up 2 billion textbook pages to millions of students around the globe, and we’re really proud of that.We’re also big believers in open standards, the open web platform and moving beyond PDF-based textbooks that are no better than print under glass. I’m here to talk to you today about what we see coming next for digital textbooks and learning content. We see books busting out of their bindings, and a need to support granular, mind-sized chunks of interactive content delivered through a panoply of new user experiences. We also see new capabilities landing in the open web platform every day – from new browser APIs that can power new learning modalities, to broader support for rich media, to a growing number of student-centric APIs available for integration. It’s time to recalibrate your mental image of a digital book, and think outside textbook.What I have to show today is a suite of demos and experiments focused on two different categories of exploration. On the one hand, modern browsers and a broad spectrum of resources available over the web have opened up new input modalities and interactive possibilities for students. On the other, we’ve worked hard to make our technology modular and interchangeable, to take that great next generation content and make it plug and play into a wide variety of environments, use cases and business models. By tapping into both sides of that equation we can not only creation a richer texture of ways for students to learn digitally, but we can deliver those powerful ideas in new and compelling ways.(2 minutes)“powerful ideas in mind-size bites”Let’s begin with the student. How can we deliver an interconnected, interactive learning experience based on textbook content? Let’s say I’m a music student. I studied music in college, and let me tell you, studying a music textbook without being able to hear the music can be an incredibly frustrating experience.“Hebrides chapter”Let’s start there – it’s trivial today to include an audio file in an EPUB 3 book or website, like I have here. Now as I read the score for one of my favorite pieces, Mendelssohn’s Hebrides Overture, I can listen along.(15 secs of the overture) We can also use Javascript to highlight the score as the audio plays, helping me better understand the texture of the piece and follow along with a complex score.(15 secs with follow-along)Of course, if audio is an option, video is as well. Let’s take a look at the London symphony orchestra playing the same piece.(15 secs of an orchestra playing the overture)We can even make the listening experience interactive. Here we have a simple exercise that allows you to tap on the screen at the speed that you’d like your “orchestra” to play. I can slow down…or speed up…to conduct my orchestra. Really fun way to explore the piece.http://www.nime.org/proceedings/2014/nime2014_281.pdfAnd using device motion APIs available in some mobile browsers, I can even conduct the orchestra with my iPhone as the baton! Take a look at this, I think it’s really cool. I wish I’d had this in my conducting practice…https://www.audero.it/demo/device-orientation-api-demo.html“timbre chapter”Or course playing back music that you’re studying is just one way in which thinking outside the traditional textbook might help you study music. Let’s jump a few chapter forward.Timbre can perhaps best be described as the color of sound – it’s what makes a flute playing a B flat sound different from a trumpet playing the same note. But it can be a difficult concept to understand and develop an intuition for. The emerging Web Audio API, used within this book can help.At the core of timbre is the sound waveform of any given note, as composited by many different pitches, known as harmonics. Here we use the web’s ability to analyze a sound in real time to do two things – graph the sound wave itself, and graph a frequency analysis of that sound in real time. 15 years ago this kind of computation would be so complex as to require a beefy computer and sophisticated software – today Chrome makes it available in the browser trivially to any website or book.Using this kind of analysis we can visually see the difference between a trumpet and a flute and better understand why timbre has the impact it does.We can even explore the possibility space of timbre by mixing and matching our own levels of harmonics – here’s what it sounds like if I try to make it sound like a trumpet. Really fun to explore.But again it’s not just about playback, we have new and interesting input modalities as well. What about the timbre of my voice singing the same note? Let’s take a look:(sing the same note into the mic, analyze the timbre).You can easily imagine many applications for recording your own music as part of this course – for example improving your ability to recognize and sing back a pitch. Goodbye multiple choice tests – this book can ask you to “sing a major third up from this note” and check your answer.“In C”Finally, this isn’t just rich media, and it isn’t just leveraging new and compelling input modalities like device motion and recording audio, but we’re also working with networked media. This means we can collaborate and learn together.For example, let’s look at a famous piece of music by Terry Riley called “In C”. “In C” is an experimental piece of music that lists out 53 short phrases and says to the participants – “play these as many times as you want, and move onto the next phrase any time you want”. Every performance of “In C” is a little bit different, and the only way to truly understand music like this is to play it – listening to a single recording won’t cut it. So what if I could play it with my classmates, in real time, over the internet? Let’s try it.(go to this URL if you want to play along)http://aleatoric.backporchrevolution.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/inc_score.gifHere we have an interactive version of “In C” – as you can see and hear, a few people have already started. We can pick our instrument and join in whenever we want – if you’re in the audience, visit this URL now to jump in (and please mute!).(30 seconds of In C).How fun was that? Even if that kind of music isn’t your cup of tea you can see it’s a really fun way to learn about it.
