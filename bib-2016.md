Think outside the textbook – powerful ideas in mind-size bites

Hi everyone – my name is Nick Brown and I’m a Director of Product Management at VitalSource. You may not have heard of us, but we’re the world’s largest digital textbook provider – last year we served up 2 billion textbook pages to millions of students around the globe, and we’re really proud of that.

We’re also big believers in open standards, the open web platform and moving beyond PDF-based textbooks that are really no better than print under glass. I’m here to talk to you today about what we see coming next for digital textbooks and learning content. We see books busting out of their bindings, and a crucial need to support granular, mind-sized chunks of interactive content delivered through a panoply of new user experiences.

We also see new capabilities landing in the open web platform every day – from new browser APIs that can power interesting new learning modalities, to broader support for rich media, to a growing number of student-centric tools and APIs available for integration. It’s time to recalibrate your mental image of a digital book, and think outside textbook.

What I have to show today is a suite of demos and experiments focused on two categories of exploration. On the one hand, modern browsers and a broad spectrum of resources available over the web have opened up all sorts of new and interesting interactive possibilities for students. I'll show you a few examples of that. On the other hand, we’ve worked hard to make our technology modular and interchangeable, to take that great next generation content and make it plug and play into a wide variety of environments, use cases and business models. By tapping into both sides of that equation we can not only create a richer texture of ways for students to learn digitally, but we can deliver those powerful ideas in new and compelling ways.

Let’s begin with the student perspective. How can we deliver an interconnected, interactive, engaging learning experience for students in and around their textbook content? Lots of ways.

For example, I studied music in college, and let me tell you, reading a music textbook without being able to hear the music can be an incredibly frustrating experience.

So let’s start there – it’s trivial today to include an audio file in an EPUB 3 book or website, like I have here. Now as I read the score for one of my favorite pieces, Mendelssohn’s Hebrides Overture, I can listen along.

(play 15 secs of the overture)

We can also use Javascript to highlight the score as the audio plays, helping me better understand the texture of the piece and follow along with a complex score.

(15 secs with follow-along)

Of course, if audio is an option, video is as well. Let’s take a look at the San Francisco symphony orchestra playing the same piece.

(15 secs of an orchestra playing the overture)

Now you'll notice we made life easy on the student by syncing the position of the score across those 3 modalities.

We can even make the listening experience interactive. Here we have a simple exercise that allows you to tap on the screen at the speed that you’d like your “orchestra” to play.

(start audio)

I can slow down…or speed up…to conduct my orchestra. Really fun way to explore the piece.

(stop audio, take out phone baton)

And, we can even go a step further. Using device motion APIs available in modern mobile browsers, I can even conduct the orchestra with my iPhone as the baton! Take a look at this, I think it’s really cool.

(conduct orchestra - slow down, speed back up, stop)

Now that's a lot of fun - I wish I’d had this when I was studying music.

“timbre chapter”

Or course playing back music that you’re studying is just one way in which thinking outside the traditional textbook might help you study music. Let’s jump a few chapters forward and study a key concept - timbre.

(open up the timbre chapter)

Timbre can perhaps best be described as the color of sound – it’s what makes a flute playing a B flat sound different from a trumpet playing the same note. But it can be a difficult concept to understand and develop an intuition for. The emerging Web Audio API and some dynamic visualizations built in the browser, we see in this chapter, can help.

At the core of the concept of timbre is the sound wave for any given note you hear, as composited by many different component sound waves, known as harmonics. Here we use the web’s ability to analyze a sound in real time to do two things – graph the sound wave itself as it's playing, and graph a frequency analysis of that sound in real time. Let's take a look.

Here's the simplest sound wave there is - a single sine curve for a single pitch. You can see a spike for the frequency of the wave, and here's the wave itself.

(play a simple waveform)

On the other hand here is a trumpet - you can see many spikes for each of the harmonic frequencies, and a very complex waveform.

(play the trumpet sound)

And here is a flute. Notice the different placement of the harmonic spikes? That's what makes a flute a flute!

(play the flute sound)

15 years ago this kind of computation would be so complex as to require a beefy computer and sophisticated software – today Chrome makes it available in the browser trivially to any website or book.

Using this kind of analysis we can visually see the difference between a trumpet and a flute and better understand why timbre has the impact it does.

We can even, again, make this interactive, and explore the possibility space of timbre by mixing and matching our own levels of harmonics – here’s what it sounds like if I try to make it sound like a trumpet.

(click around in teropa's timbre widget)

Really fun to explore.

But again it’s not just about playback and clicking around, we have new and interesting input capabilities as well. What about the timbre of my voice singing the same note? Let’s take a look:

(sing the same note into the mic, analyze the timbre).

Interesting differences, huh? You can think of lots of great use cases for capturing live audio, not just in music but in a variety of courses.

“In C”

Finally, this isn’t just rich media, and it isn’t just leveraging new and compelling input tools like device motion and live audio capture, but we’re also working with networked media. This means we can collaborate and learn together.

For example, let’s look at a famous piece of music by Terry Riley called “In C”. “In C” is an experimental piece of music that lists out 53 musical phrases and says to the participants – “play these as many times as you want, and move onto the next phrase any time you want”. Every performance of “In C” is unique, and the only way to truly understand music like this is to play it with other people – listening to a single recording won’t cut it. So what if I could play it with my classmates, in real time, over the internet? Let’s try out it.

(go to this URL if you want to play along)

Here we have an interactive version of “In C” – as you can see and hear, a few people have already started. We can pick our instrument and join in whenever we want – if you’re in the audience, visit this URL now to jump in (and please mute!).

(30 seconds of In C).

How fun was that? Even if that kind of music isn’t your cup of tea you can see it’s a really fun way to learn about it. These kinds of live, real-time collaborative learning experiences with your peers, outside of the classroom, can be a really powerful way to learn that is only possible in this kind of interactive, networked environment.

(intro slide for part 2)

So, now, let's flip the script. One we've got these kinds of powerful mind-sized chunks of content, how can we get the most mileage out of them? Clearly these aren't as simple to produce as exporting your standard printer PDF and posting it on the web - what can we do to get more value out of the effort put into creating this kind of advanced content?

(LearnKit overview slide)

At VitalSource, our answer to that question is a technology we call LearnKit. LearnKit is a set of APIs and SDKs that allows partners - be they publishers, institutions, edtech startups, whoever - to quickly and easily create new learning experiences wrapped around any content delivered in our platform.

What does that mean to you? That means that you can create a next-generation EPUB 3 once, get it into our system and use the content in that book in any number of ways, without rebuilding all of the complex backend architecture that you need to be a best-in-class learning platform. No need to build a content licensing model, note and highlight cross-device syncing, enterprise-level content DRM, a real-time analytics pipeline - instead, you get to focus on the user experience. Let's take a quick tour through a few examples.

(back to Timbre chapter)

The first example is actually...this presentation! Each of the screens I've been showing so far are part of an EPUB 3 book, which is ingested into our platform and licensed to me - if I actually had logged into this presentation as a different user I wouldn't have seen those slides. I used the LearnKit Javascript API to render out those EPUB 3 content documents right into the flow of an HTML presentation.

To contrast that, we could look at the same presentation within Bookshelf, our etextbook platform.

(show Timbre chapter within Bookshelf)

Here you can see the same chapter on "Timbre" within the Bookshelf UI and UX. Where you'll see you can search the content, create notes and highlights, navigate around the entire book and more. It's a fully-featured ereader. We've been building on top of LearnKit for over a year now - every page viewed in the last year, all 2 billion of them, were viewed using LearnKit.

(Bookshelf labeled slide)

Let's take a quick look under the hood. I've labeled a few key areas of Bookshelf with the function that you'd call to pull back data. Retrieve the table of contents, get the user's highlights, render page 5 - these are the kinds of tools LearnKit exposes to the browser. Of course you can use these to build something that looks completely different from Bookshelf, maybe to build towards a different market or vertical quickly.

(Storia labeled slide)

For example, here is a kid-friendly reader built using LearnKit that looks completely different. We built this in a partnership with Scholastic, and while you can see it uses those same functions, as I have them labeled here, and under the hood 95% of the platform is the same, the reading experience is much more appropriate for Scholastic's grade school audience.

Of course you don't need to build an entire ereader. We're currently working with multiple  partners who want to display just a small chunk of content in another context. For example, think of an adaptive courseware platform, that allows the learner to get a question wrong and right there within that context see the appropriate chunk of content to set them back on the right track.

The key here is to get the student the right content or interactive exercise - not to build a lot of bells and whistles and features around it, or overwhelm them with an entire textbook.

(content snippet viewer)

That kind of simple content snippet experience is really easy to build with LearnKit. You can see in this example that we can set the start and stop page, or tweak it, and just the perfect chunk of content will render out. Build the content once - it may be just a portion of text, it may be our interactive collaborative "In C" music player, or anything in between - and reuse that chunk of content as often as you need in any context.

(Bookshelf GPS)

One last example shows how this kind of content reuse isn't important just for students. This is a tool that we call Bookshelf GPS, built in partnership with a company called Cerego.

Bookshelf GPS enables instructors to add a rich engagement layer on top of an existing textbook, building a bank of concepts and ideas they want their students to learn. How do they author that structured bank of knowledge? Using LearnKit!

(Rainna's GPS video, instructor)

Here you can see side by side, the source material in the textbook, and Cerego's authoring tools. An instructor can copy material from the text, drag and drop over their highlighted passages or pull from a list of the key figures and diagrams in the book, all extracted using simple LearnKit calls, to make their activity creation even faster.

(Rainna's GPS video, student)

Then on the student side of things, as they're studying those learning items that have been assigned to them, if there's one they don't know, they can quickly bounce back and forth into the source text, and back to the question answering tool, again with that content embedded using LearnKit.

(let's wrap it up, some closing slide)

Add it all up and this is the kind of flexibility afforded to us by the digital medium we're working in - we can support reusing simple content chunks, building complex learning applications, rolling all kinds of flavors of ereaders, embedding page viewers, creating interactive authoring environments, and more, all wrapped around the same source content.

And that content can be far removed from a flat print textbook - we can use audio and video and visual media, we can leverage new input and interaction modalities, and build integrated collaborative experiences, baked right into our books files using EPUB 3.

This is what will enable us to break out from a world of paper under glass textbooks. What can your content be? Where can that content go? Let's find out. Let's think outside the textbook.

Thanks.
