Work off of the MVJ demo - the presentation itself is an EPUB reader.

Lots of decks are HTML pages or EPUB docs - this one is a reader!

I was a music major, and let me tell you a music textbook without music is dull. Unless you're Mozart, reading a complex piece like this one is near impossible. Especially if you're new or struggling.

Music is also begging for new input modes like recording, new interactions like drawing notes, keyboards to play a tune....so many possibilities.

So here's our reader and I want to walk you through some chapters in what we think a next gen music textbook could be.

* play music (sound slice?)
* Spotify integration
* record audio, play it back
* on screen keyboard, play back a tune
* play along to a track
* draw notes on a staff, guess if they're right
* integrate with deepjazz, make a model off my tune
* timbre explorer (multitouch)
* timbre analysis and Fourier transform
* email me my song (mailgun)
* twilio integration (text a number for some reason)
* play rock band
* Watson avatar with beethoven type stuff
* more...

* record interaction
* report back results (what key is this in?)
